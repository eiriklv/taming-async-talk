Taming Asynchronous JavaScript
====================================================

Code examples from my [Taming Asynchronous JavaScript](http://slides.com/eiriklv/taming-async-talk) talk.

You will need io.js >= 1.0.4 to run the examples, except for the one using fibers/fibrous which requires node.js >= 0.10.x
